# Digit Recognizer

A simple program to recognize the digit drawn by the User using a colored marker.(**Blue** by default)
This marker is segmented out and any digit you draw using this marker is sent a Convolutional Neural Network(trained on the MNIST dataset) which then predicts the digit you are drawing.

**Note** :  
1.To run this program run *opencv_drawing.py*  
2.The trained Tensorflow models required are already present  
3.The file *MNISTrainer.py* was using local files to train and is only present to give an idea of the network structure.
